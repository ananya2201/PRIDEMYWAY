            <br>As of 2020, 17% of the total population of India, identified as not heterosexual, excluding those who “did not know” and those who preferred “not to say.”
    <br> While the society has certainly come a long, commendable way in accepting colour, there is, undeniably a long way to go. To this day, a large proportion of people hesitate from embracing themselves, fueled by the fear of societal and peer disapproval. 
            
             <br>We, at My Pride, embrace color. We aim at building a community for the LGBTIQA+ and for all others alike, for all those who wish to interact, help and grow with like minded people. We want everyone to have someone to talk to, to motivate them to love themselves, and remind them that they are not alone.

             <br>Our website and the community we’re building, firmly believes in showing its true colours- openly, unabashedly.
